## ASSEMBLY CODE to OBJECT CODE TRANSLATOR

### Introduction
This project is to read assembly code program as input assuming the instructions are valid.
Find all the symbols like constants, defined variables, functions, labels and literals and make a table of them.
This is done during the 1st pass of 2-Pass Assembler.
Finally, a symbol table which contains all the symbols from each file which is passed as argument will be tabulated.
It can also generate listing file and literal table.
This literal table is created during 1st pass, but error table is created during 2nd pass.
So, this project does all the work done by a standard assembler.
It also lists errors in the assembly code if any.


### Prerequisites

Before you continue, ensure you have met the following requirements.

- You have installed the latest version of Python.
- You are using a Linux Machine.
- You need to install "tabulate" module using the command "pip install tabulate".
- You have a basic understanding of Python Programming.
- You should know what is symbol table and literal table in Assembler.
- You have a good grab on Assembly level Instructions to understand the code.
- You have atleast a little knowledge on rules for conversion from Assembly code to Object code.

### Installation / Execution


To create listing file for single assembly code file:
- Save the directory called listing_file.
- Write few Assembly level instructions in file named "prog.asm".
(Note : There are already few Instructions written in the file, you can modify them or add few.)
- Install tabulate module using the command "pip install tabulate".
- Run the python file named "trans.py" with the following command:
  - python trans.py

To create symbol table and literal table for single assembly code file:
- Save the directory called symbol_table and literal_table.
- Write few Assembly level instructions in file named "prog.asm".
(Note : There are already few Instructions written in the file, you can modify them or add few.)
- Install tabulate module using the command "pip install tabulate".
- Run the python file named "trans.py" with the following command:
  - python trans.py
  
To create symbol table for 2 or more input files:
- Save the directory called symbol_table for 2 or more files.
- Write few Assembly level instructions in file named "prog.asm".
(Note : There are already few Instructions written in the file, you can modify them or add few.)
- Install tabulate module using the command "pip install tabulate".
- Run the python file named "combined_symbol_table.py" with the following command:
  - python combined_symbol_table.py

To look for errors in assembly code file:
 - Save the directory called errors_list.
- Write few Assembly level instructions in file named "prog.asm".
(Note : There are already few Instructions written in the file, you can modify them or add few.)
- Install tabulate module using the command "pip install tabulate".
- Run the python file named "trans.py" with the following command:
  - python trans.py
